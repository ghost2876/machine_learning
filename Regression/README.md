Regression

SLR (Simple Linear 1) / MLR (Multiple Linear p-1) / Polynomial / Interaction Regression

intercept, slope, random error term

explanatory/independent variable/predictors (X), explained/dependent variable/response (Y)

MLR的时候，构成的是response surface, not regression line, P290

 ### Polynomial Regression, P372 - Hierarchical Approach, Higher pow of a term is retained, then all related terms are also retained.

 ### Interaction Regression, interaction term
