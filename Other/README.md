### supervised & unsupervised learning：

 BMA-2笔记搜索"监督"，difference: we know the response or not (do we have training data? Can we label that manually?)

 (1) supervised learning: Linear/Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression (actually for classification), Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, kNN (uses training data's labels), Naive Bayes

 (2) unsupervised learning: k-means, Apriori, FP-Growth, PCA, SVD

### 解释一下Gradient Descent有哪些种类，大致有哪些区别？

Stochastic Gradient Descent, Batch Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent
